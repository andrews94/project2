To set up the application, first clone down this repo.  Once in the directory for the app, run rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed in terminal, and then run "rails s" to start the server.  The purpose of this app is to create your own champion guide for league of legends.  It allows you to add your own skills, descriptions, and videos to make a personalized champion guide to teach you each champion.  For my app, the MVP was full CRUD functionality that would allow the app to serve its basic purpose.  Past the MVP would be to add a lot of styling and other aesthetics to make it look very professional.  Technologies used to create this app include ruby on rails, postgres, ActiveRecord, HTML, and CSS.
