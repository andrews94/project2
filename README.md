To set up the application, first clone down this repo.  Once in the directory for the app, run rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed in terminal, and then run "rails s" to start the server.  

The purpose of this app is to create your own champion guide for league of legends.  It allows you to add your own skills, descriptions, and videos to make a personalized champion guide to teach you each champion.  This will allow you to study the champions and learn their respective mechanics in a fun and interactive way.  It is kind of like a game but better.  

For my app, the MVP was full CRUD functionality that would allow the app to serve its basic purpose.  Past the MVP would be to add a lot of styling and other aesthetics to make it look very professional.  Further additions would be a personalized experiene for each user featuring a login and logout system using devise (i wish i could have done that)

Technologies used to create this app include ruby on rails, postgres, ActiveRecord, HTML, and CSS.
